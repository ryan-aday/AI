If you have just 2 pointers to the left and right (larger and smaller) children of that node, then walk the tree carefully, and set those pointers in every node to None. This must be done from the bottom up. Once all of the pointers to a block of memory (in this case, a node) are removed, that block of memory becomes inaccessible, and should be collected by the garbage-collector later."
